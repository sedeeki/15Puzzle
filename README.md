# 15Puzzle
The famous 15 Puzzle Game in Python

The 15 Puzzle game is built on the GUI library PyQt5. 
Its a single file. 


How its played: 

You move the boxes on click in a way that the 2d board is in ascending order and the last box is an empty box. 
So a 4x4 box would start at 1 and end at 15 with the 16th place containing the empty black box.
